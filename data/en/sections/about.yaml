# a summary about you
summary: 'I am a political philosopher of technology. My background in computer science and philosophy allows me to reflect deeply on the new anthropological changes brought by AI and other emerging technologies. I am a founding member of the [Berlin Ethics Lab](https://www.philtech.tu-berlin.de/menue/berlin_ethics_lab/parameter/en/) and of the art collective [Trial & Theresa](http://trialandtheresa.de/). I also give talks, interviews, write and educate. I think critically about technology with the hope to improve their governance, centering intersectionality and global justice.'
