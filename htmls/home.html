    <p>I am a <em>philosopher of technology</em>, with a special interest in <em>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</em>. I investigate both AI ethics and politics.</p>  
    <p>These technologies bring new anthropological questions at the intersection of culture and justice. To study these latter, I developped the concept of <em>scalability</em>.</p>
    <p>I am a PhD candidate and researcher at Technische Universit√§t Berlin (Berlin Institute of Technology). Currently, I am also a visiting student at the <em>Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence (CFI)</em> (University of Cambridge).</p>
